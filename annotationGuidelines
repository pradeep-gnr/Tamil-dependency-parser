Tamil Dependency Annotation Hints/conventions:

1) If a compound named entity (Names, Organizations etc) is encountered, then the last word forms the root of the entity and initial words in the entity are attached to the root.

2) The last fullstop is attached to the word before that. 

Eg. Avan angu sendran. 

Here '.' will be attached to sendran.

3) When compound clauses in the form of quotes occur - then annotation is carried out according to the following example.

Avan sonnan, "Angu edharku selgirirgal".

Here "sonnan" will be the root and "selgirargal".

The head of the sub-clause will be attached to the root of the main head.

4) The quotes in quotations which will be symbols are attached to the head of the main clause.

5) A common trend that I have noticed is that the final verb (VM) is most likely the head verb. 

6) Pronun tokens mostly attach to their corresponding noun!

7) When connecting phrases like 'endru' (UT Pos tag occurs), they usually connect compound noun Phrases and 

8) RB POS tag words like (Maaraga, atharkaga) usually connect to head verbs in the corresponding clause.

10) For connecting conjunctions such as "mattrum", Eg John matrum sam pottiyil pangetrinar (John and Sam), the head of the connective "mattrum" will be the second noun here (sam). 

11) When consecutive adjectives are encountered, the head of both the adjectives will the corresponding entity/verb that they are describing. 

For example, Azhagana, thairiyamana pen (beautiful bold girl). The head of both "azhagana" and "thairiyamana" will be "pen"
